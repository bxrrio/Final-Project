# Final-Project
This is how my project is going so far. I'm having a bit of trouble with the layout but I'm sure I will figure it out. 
This is the Home page of my website. As of right now it looks decent, but I'm going to change and add a few more things. 
I'm going to make another page dedicated to my art and animations once I'm done with the home page and from there I'll see what else I can do to make it look better.
